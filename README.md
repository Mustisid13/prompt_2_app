TODO App using Chat GPT.

## Prompt
I'm building a Flutter TODO app with a focus on modern UI/UX and smooth animations. Please suggest suitable color schemes and design patterns. For state management, I'd like to use the BLOC pattern.

Key Features:

Firebase Integration: Implement basic CRUD operations for todos, including adding, editing, deleting, and retrieving tasks.
Task Prioritization: Allow users to assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
Task Filtering: Provide a filter option to view tasks based on their priority levels.
Code Architecture:

Please outline a recommended code structure or provide a basic code skeleton that I can adapt to my project. This should include components for tasks, screens (e.g., home, add task), and necessary state management classes.als,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Note: The AI provides you the code but sometimes there might be need to configure the code as per need and version of packages used by AI. Also the result might vary based on different AI models.
