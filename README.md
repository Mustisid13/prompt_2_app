A new Flutter project.

## Prompt

Create a Flutter app for a tic-tac-toe game with the following features:

Offline functionality: The app should function without an internet connection.
Local storage: Store the scores of previous games locally.
Three-round format: Each game consists of three rounds. The player who wins two rounds consecutively or has the highest total wins the game.
Player names: At the start of each game, allow users to enter their names.
Winner popup: Display a popup message announcing the winner at the end of each game.
Specific requirements:

Home screen:
Display the start game button with an attractive design.
Show the scores of previous games in a visually appealing format.
Use animations to enhance the user experience.
Game screen:
Provide a tic-tac-toe board with a visually pleasing design.
Allow players to enter their names before starting with smooth animations.
Display a popup when a game ends, announcing the winner with eye-catching animations.
Additional considerations:

Aesthetic UI:
Choose a color palette that is visually appealing and easy on the eyes.
Use fonts and typography that are legible and enhance the overall look of the app.
Ensure that the layout is well-organized and easy to navigate.
Animations:
Use subtle animations to make the app feel more interactive and engaging.
Consider using animations for transitions between screens, button clicks, and other user interactions.
Avoid using excessive animations that can slow down the app or distract from the gameplay.

Note: The AI provides you the code but sometimes there might be need to configure the code as per need and version of packages used by AI. Also the result might vary based on different AI models.
